While many entrepreneurs put their own money into their companies, this isn't possible for everyone, and this is why business support grants and programs are so important.&nbsp;In this guide, we will take you through the best ways that eligible businesses can apply for grant funding and receive financial assistance to help get their small business to where they want them to be.&nbsp;How to Apply For Small Business GrantTo apply for small business grants in Australia, you will need to conduct a few processes to get the ball rolling. From hitting eligibility criteria to getting in touch with the correct support services, there are many things to consider.&nbsp;How does Australia Help Small Business Tenants?&nbsp;If you are struggling to find your feet as a small business owner, you may be wondering what help is available to you in Australia. Fortunately, there are an incredible amount of small business grants available in Australia that can take eligible applicants from small business tenants to established entrepreneurs.&nbsp;An example of how forward-thinking the Australian government is regarding small businesses is the three-month payroll tax waiver many businesses received due to being negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-2021.&nbsp;Ultimately, the type of grant funding you are eligible to receive will depend on the region where your business is based. The best way to find this information is by going to your local government site or the central Australian government hub.How to find out if you are one of the eligible businessesTo be eligible for receiving a small business grant, businesses will need to have an active Australian business number, also known as an ABN. An Australian business number is an 11 digit number used as a form of identification for business transactions, allowing the Australian Taxation Office to identify business operations.&nbsp;Aside from needing an active Australian business number for handling invoices and other essential business procedures, you will also need this ID number when applying for government loans.&nbsp;All eligible applicants should have an ABN, so make sure you set yours up through the Australian Business Register before applying for any loans to avoid being turned away empty-handed.&nbsp;Business support grantsNow that you know how small businesses can become eligible for business grants, it is time to detail which grants and programs are worth keeping on your radar. If you find any grant opportunities through independent research, be sure to check for credibility before accepting any conditions, as small businesses are easy for criminals to take advantage of.With that being said, we will only include official government grants in our list to assure you that each of these options is from credible and reliable sources.Business Boost Grant Program: The business boost grant program supports small business tenants with future planning, automated software, and the development and management of staff. Eligible businesses can receive up to $15,000. However, eligibility criteria for the business boost program are decided upon aspects such as having fewer than 20 employees, an ABN, and a Queensland headquarters, meaning this program isn't so accessible for South Australian businesses.The Entrepreneurs' Program- The Entrepreneur's program, which isn't based on location, is a more accessible option for all small businesses. You can apply for growth services to help support a business's financial situation or accelerate commercialisation to help beverage businesses and other businesses with products get their ideas out into the industry with marketing.Landing Pads: For startups, the best option to go with is the Landing Pads program. Although landing pads don't specifically give businesses access to money and funding, they do provide startups with essential connections to drive their businesses to succeed in the early stages. The main objective of landing pads is to help companies wishing to export their goods to other countries, giving entrepreneurs essential access to a global networking hub.Location specific programs and grants- Within the Australian government's funding and program page, you can filter in your area to see specific results for your location. Doing this helps to ensure you can receive more detailed support, whether you are in the hospitality sector or wish to look into the Performing Arts, Theatres, and Cinemas assistance program.Alternatively, you can look at specific government sites for your area to see if any private companies or financial support services are available. For example, the Western Australian government started nine support programs for the education and events sectors earlier in 2022, helping with payments to eligible event suppliers for ticketed events.Other services are available in other parts of the country, in which businesses can apply for support with eligible costs, rent relief, and other issues small businesses face. In addition, there will be grants available in each area of Australia, so be sure to check with your local government hub and services for this information."
